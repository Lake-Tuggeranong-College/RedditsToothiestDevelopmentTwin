# Overview

This project is being developed by the Website Development class in Semester 2, 2023.

The goals of this project are:

- A Reddit clone
- Plain, vanilla PHP with Bootstrap for UI
- No frameworks
- User Management (login, logout, register, etc.)
- Posts (create, read, update, delete)
- Moderation (delete posts, ban users, etc.)

## What is product/service/concept

Students were given a challenge to produce a website as an homage to Reddit, where users can post content and other users can vote on that content.

Students were developing this as a group, with each student responsible for a different part of the project. Github was used to manage the project.
